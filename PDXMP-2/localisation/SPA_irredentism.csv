EVTDESC170413;In an act of impudence bordering on outright hostility, the Spanish have reasserted their claim on the Rock of Gibraltar, ceded to us over a century ago, and have expelled our diplomats without warning. Gibraltar being the lynchpin to free naval access to the Mediterranean Sea, surrendering it would be a massive blow to British commerce, power projection, and prestige. ignoring such a ridiculous claim as should be appropriate would do nothing to refute their claim to Gibraltar. The only way to rebuke this act of insolence is through force, with all the cost it would incur for both our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC170414;The cowardly British have acknowledged our supremacy and handed back our rightful lands.

EVTNAME170415;The Loss of Gibraltar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC170415;The once-thought impenetrable fortress of Gibraltar has fallen to the Spanish. With it goes our control over the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea and all guarantees over free trade into and out of the southern belly of Europe. Already, Spanish newspapers gloat over the victory while our domestic press is in conniptions. What awaits after the fingerpointing is uncertain. All we know now is that we have lost a vital part of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC170416; How is it that Gibraltar is so close to us, yet still always out of our grasp? The impenetrable fortress of Gibraltar has lived up to its reputation. Despite constant bombardment, the fortifications held while our forces were repelled on other fronts. Humiliated and bruised, all we can do now is lick our wounds and give up on our dreams of restoring our borders to their former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME170417;The Spanish Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC170417;...Article 15: The Royal Government of Portugal will take steps to denounce any slander published by domestic press against the authority of the Spanish Crown, as befitting the relations between two allies. \nArticle 16: The Royal Government of Portugal will consult the Spanish ambassador regarding any diplomatic matters concerning the other Great Powers, economic relations, colonial governance...\n\n A telegraph from Madrid has thrown the Cortes Gerais into conniptions. The dozens of conditions and guidelines it outlines essentially amounts to surrendering all sovereignty to the Spanish Crown. On one hand, becoming a Spanish puppet would throw the country into disarray. On the other, the alternative is clearly war against a resurgent Spanish army. We can petition the British and French governments for aid but, ultimately, it will be up to us to decide whether we will stand down to protect our people or fight for our freedom once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC170418;Drunk on our latest success, we thought we could take on the world.

EVTDESC170419;While the occasional partisan peeks his rifle out to take potshots at Spanish dignataries in the streets every so often, Portugal is, for the most part, firmly in our grasp. The peninsula is once again united and Iberia stands on the precipice of a new age. .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC170420;In an act of impudence bordering on outright hostility, the Spanish have reasserted their claim on province of Rousillon, ceded to us over a century ago, and have expelled our diplomats without warning. Perpignan being the a key bastion on the Pyrenees against potential Spanish incursions, surrendering it would be a massive blow to French national security and prestige. Unfortunately, ignoring such a ridiculous claim as should be appropriate would do nothing to refute their claim to Rousillon.

EVTDESC170422;Despite the protection of the mountains, Perpignan has fallen back to Spanish hands. With it goes our control over eastern portion of the Pyrenees and the defenses it afforded the southern flatlands of France.

gib_gibraltar_title;Reclaim Gibraltar;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gib_gibraltar_desc;The Rock of Gibraltar sits fortified at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea at its narrowest point, allowing its owner complete control over naval movement into and out of the maritime heart of Europe. Ever since our ignominious defeat during the Succession War of 1700, the perfidious British have held this vital fortification despite our best efforts at reclaiming it and now hold Mediterranean commerce as their captive. If we are to ever truly reclaim our ancestral greatness, we must correct this ancestral wrong, even if it brings us to war with those who occupy Gibraltar.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

poor_portugal_title;Reunite with Portugal;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor_portugal_desc;Ever since the founding days of the United Spanish Crown, the monarchs of Aragon and Castile have sought to bind the lands of Portugal in union with the other Spanish Kingdoms. While our last attempt to bring Portugal into the fold were frustrated in 1640, our recent restoration to the world stage begs the question of if we can restore Portugal to its rightful place in a united Iberian peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

poor_poor_portugal_desc;At long last, we have finally fulfilled the long sought after dream of generations of Spanish monarchs: Portugal is united with Aragon and Castile once more. With this, we are now one step closer to actualizing a united Iberian peninsula, uncontested and unbreakable by any outsiders!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rule_rousillon_title;Reclaim Perpignan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rule_rousillon_desc;For centuries, Perpignan stood as our stalwart guardian against French aggression. With the Pyrenees to its back and the Gulf of Lion to its side, it acted as one of the chokepoints that defended us against French numerical superiority until it was taken in 1642. Now, with the might of all Iberia at our back, we can avenge this injustice and reclaim la Fedelissima, the Most Faithful City!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have forged a new Iberia, tempered by war and united in dreams of greatness. But we are not simply reclaiming the glory of our forefathers. No, our union will be greater than the sum of the kingdoms united. Mi emperador, it is time to the announce the Iberian Union and let the world tremble before it.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
